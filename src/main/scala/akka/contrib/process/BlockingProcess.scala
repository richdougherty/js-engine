/**
 * Process encapsulates an operating system process and its ability to be communicated with
 * via stdio i.e. stdin, stdout and stderr. The sink for stdin and the sources for stdout
 * and stderr are communicated in a Started event upon the actor being established. The
 * receiving actor (passed in as a constructor arg) is then subsequently sent stdout and
 * stderr events. When there are no more stdout or stderr events then the process's exit
 * code is communicated to the receiver as an int value. The exit code will always be
 * the last event communicated by the process unless the process is a detached one.
 *
 * The actor is expected to be associated with a blocking dispatcher as various calls are made
 * to input and output streams which can block.
